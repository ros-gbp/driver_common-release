    sent to a callback, and a QueuedTriggerMatcher with the previous
    functionality of TriggerMatcher.
  * Added a reset method to the TriggerMatcher
  * Wrote skeleton for PeriodicTimestampMinFilter.
  * Wrote TriggerMatcher class to synchronize exact trigger time stamps with
    approximate timestamps incoming from hardware. Wrote self tests for it.
